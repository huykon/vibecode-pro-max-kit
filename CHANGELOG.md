# Changelog

All notable changes to vibecode-pro-max-kit are documented in this file.

## [3.2.5] - 2026-06-21

### Docs

- **Windows install guidance.** Users running the `curl … install.sh | bash` one-liner in PowerShell/`cmd.exe` hit an immediate failure because the installer is a bash script. The script itself already supports Windows shells (it detects `OSTYPE=msys*`/`cygwin*`/WSL, falls back from symlinks to copying when Developer Mode is off, and `.gitattributes` enforces `eol=lf` so shebangs never CRLF-corrupt) — the gap was purely documentation: the README listed only `macOS / Linux / WSL` and never mentioned **Git Bash**, which ships with Git for Windows and runs the existing command as-is. Added an explicit Windows section to the install prerequisites: run inside Git Bash or WSL (not PowerShell/cmd), with a note that symlink → copy fallback is automatic and Developer Mode enables true symlinks. No script changes.

## [3.2.4] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Data-loss fix in `install.sh`:** the legacyDeletions pass `rm -rf`'d every listed directory unconditionally, including process-layout content dirs (`process/general-plans/reports`, `process/general-plans/references`, and the `_seeds` equivalents). Because `install.sh` is deterministic (no agent) it cannot run the adaptive safe-migration that `vc-update` Part D performs — so on the documented `curl install.sh | bash` upgrade path, a project with real reports/references content under those dirs would have that content **permanently destroyed** before `vc-update` ever ran. `install.sh` now guards process-layout content dirs: any non-empty `reports/` or `references/` directory under `process/` is **deferred** (preserved, not deleted) with a notice to run `vc-update`, which migrates the contents into task folders before removing the now-empty dir. Deprecated harness dirs (e.g. `.claude/skills/vc-*`) and dead files carry no user content and are still removed. Verified against a real v2.4.1 project: 15 real report/reference files preserved, 0 user-content loss, deprecated harness still cleaned up.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- `vc-update` no longer skips the adaptive content migration when the installed version already matches the remote. Previously, version equality (`Step 5: Compare Versions`) stopped the run immediately — but the deterministic `install.sh` writes `.vc-version` to the new version *without* being able to run the adaptive legacy-layout migration (it has no agent). The documented upgrade flow is "run `curl install.sh | bash`, then run `vc-update` to finish migrating old folders" — yet `vc-update` would bail with "Already up to date. No changes applied," stranding legacy `reports/`/`references/` dirs and flat plans un-migrated. Now version equality runs a legacy-artifact scan first: if legacy-format dirs/plans exist, `vc-update` continues to the apply path and Part D migrates them into task folders (file diff stays empty, version unchanged); only when no legacy artifacts remain does it report up-to-date and stop. Fixed in both the skill body and the `references/vc-update.md` deep reference.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- `legacyDeletions` self-contradiction removed: the ledger carried both the bare directory `process/development-protocols/references` AND the live, shipped file `process/development-protocols/references/program-goal-charter-template.md` underneath it. On `vc-update`/install the bare-dir deletion would recursively wipe the directory — destroying the charter template that `all-development-protocols.md` references. The bare-dir entry is dropped (ledger 23→22); the two genuinely-dead PRD files under that path remain individually listed, so the template survives an upgrade while the dead files are still cleaned up.
- Shipped the missing `validate-agent-frontmatter.mjs` validator. The agent-frontmatter behavior validator existed in the development harness and is referenced by the audit suite, but a prior publish never copied it into the kit — so no install or `vc-update` could ever run it. It is now part of the kit's `.claude/skills/vc-audit-vc/scripts/` set.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- `legacyDeletions` ledger now actually shipped: the kit was stranded at 16 entries while v3.2.0's changelog advertised 23. The 7 deprecated `reports/`/`references/` stale-dir paths (`process/general-plans/reports`, `process/general-plans/references`, `process/development-protocols/references`, and 4 `_seeds` reports/references paths) are now present, so a downstream `vc-update` will clean them up as intended.
- `AGENTS.md` task-folder convention propagated: the kit's `AGENTS.md` still taught the deprecated `reports/`/`references/` sibling-dir layout (instructing agents to *create* those dirs). It now describes the task-folder convention and safe legacy-dir migration, matching the seed guides and `vc-setup`/`vc-update`.

### Changed

- `vc-publish` no longer silently drops non-version manifest fields. The publish flow now reconciles `vc-manifest.json` explicitly: `version` is bumped, `legacyDeletions` (the deprecation ledger — a literal path array, not a glob) is auto-synced dev→kit every publish, and all other fields run through a field-level drift report so packaging deltas (test-file excludes, kit-only tooling) are reconciled consciously instead of silently desyncing. This is the root-cause fix for the two misses above.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Seed `_GUIDE` templates rewritten for the task-folder structure — deprecated `reports/` and `references/` sibling-dir guidance removed from all 6 seed guides.
- `vc-setup` Merge Mode: detects an already-installed harness, auto-migrates stale `reports/`/`references/` folders into the task-folder layout, with a conservative pre-create safe-inference fallback and dual-file (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) sync.
- `vc-update` safe-migration-before-deletion sequencing and 5-class orphan detection with a `.vc-orphaned-dirs.log` audit trail.
- `legacyDeletions` expanded from 16 to 23 entries (7 new literal stale-dir paths).
- Autopilot Mode protocol additions and phase-program / plan-lifecycle protocol refinements.

### Changed

- 52 managed files updated across Claude agents, Codex mirror, `vc-setup`/`vc-update`/`vc-autopilot` skills, seed guides, and development protocols.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Frontmatter-driven keyword routing with a drift-proof generated skills catalog/index — skills are discovered from `trigger_keywords` frontmatter instead of a hand-maintained table.
- `vc-setup` now delegates context-group authoring to `vc-generate-context` rather than scaffolding groups inline.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-14

### Breaking Changes

- Removed 11 deprecated skills: `vc-docs`, `vc-repomix`, `vc-xia`, `vc-chrome-devtools`, `vc-tech-graph`, `vc-watzup`, `vc-mcp-management`, `vc-context-engineering`, `vc-preview`, `vc-team`, `vc-merge-worktree`
- `vc-update` now applies `legacyDeletions` automatically — these dirs will be removed from your project on next upgrade
- PRD example references moved from `process/development-protocols/references/` to `.claude/skills/vc-generate-plan/references/`
- `parallel-fan-out.md` and `intent-clarification.md` removed — content merged into `orchestration.md`
- `vc-manifest.json` merge field now covers `.claude/settings.json` only (CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are no longer auto-merged by vc-update; they are updated by vc-update's normal file-copy logic)
